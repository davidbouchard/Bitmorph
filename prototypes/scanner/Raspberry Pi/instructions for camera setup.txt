Instructions for setting up camera for Raspberry Pi

1. Attach the camera to the raspberry pi. Make sure you enable the camera. 
To do this open the Terminal. Use the following command:
	sudo raspi-config
Enable the camera in the menu that displays
You will have to reboot the Pi for it to start up

You can test if the camera is working by using the following command
	raspistill -o cam.jpg

2. After it reboots, make sure everything is up to date by running the following comands
	sudo apt-get update
	sudo apt-get upgrade
	sudo rpi-update

3. Next set up to install for SimpleCV
	sudo apt-get install ipython python-opencv python-scipy python-numpy python-setuptools python-pip 
	sudo pip install https://github.com/sightmachine/SimpleCV/zipball/master	

You can test to see if it installed properly by running the following command in python 2.7. No errors means it worked
	import SimpleCV

***You might get an error saying svgwrite is missing. Type the following command in the Linux Terminal to install it
	sudo pip install svgwrite	

4. Install the UV4L driver next. In the Raspberry Pi terminal type the following
	curl http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/lrkey.asc | sudo apt-key add -

5. We have to modify the sources.list file next. The file is located in /etc/apt/sources.list
Add the following line to the bottom of the file
	deb http://www.linux-projects.org/listing/uv4l_repo/raspbian/ wheezy main

6. Make sure we have the latest version of the driver with the following commands
	sudo apt-get update			<---just to make sure the dependencies we installed in step 3 aren't outdated
	sudo apt-get install uv4l uv4l-raspicam

7. To make sure the driver is loaded at boot do the following command
	sudo apt-get install uv4l-raspicam-extras

8. We need to configure the driver next.  *********Very important*********
	sudo pkill uv4l <---this makes sure we stop the driver before configuring
	uv4l --driver raspicam --auto-video_nr --width 1920 --height 1080 --encoding jpeg 

9. Next you need to install Zbar. Back in the Raspberry Pi terminal type the following command
	sudo apt-get install python-zbar
 
you can test to see if it installed properly by running the following command in python 2.7. No errors means it worked
	import zbar

10. Now finally the python code itself. Make a new .py file with the following code.
#############################################################################################
	import SimpleCV
	import zbar

	from SimpleCV import Color,Camera,Display

	cam = Camera()  #starts the camera
	display = Display() 

	while(display.isNotDone()):
 
 		img = cam.getImage() #gets image from the camera

 		barcode = img.findBarcode() #finds barcode data from image
 		if(barcode is not None): #if there is some data processed
   			barcode = barcode[0] 
   			result = str(barcode.data)
   			print result #prints result of barcode in python shell
   			barcode = [] #reset barcode data to empty set

 	img.save(display) #shows the image on the screen
############################################################################################
11. Execute the new file in python 2.7. The camera should now be scanning for QR Codes.
It'll display anything it scans as text in the python execution terminal
