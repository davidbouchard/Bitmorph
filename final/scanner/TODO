Todo list for the raspberry pi:

- add special code handling for the Processing sketch:
  - code to show your IP address 
  - special "demo" code?
  
- disable screen saver

- create a script to check in every 10 minutes into the database for a health check 
- if possible, make the same script register the device's IP address for troubleshooting

- test fullscreen mode with keystone and 1248x1024 resolution
