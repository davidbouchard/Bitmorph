Notes about Raspberry PI:
- ping before ssh? 

ping 169.254.0.1
ssh pi@169.254.0.1

- pkill java seems to trigger a restart of the app.  not when you quit it properly though. maybe try different signals? 
- talk about startup scripts
- talk about repository locations 
- talk about config.properties 
- talk about keyboard options 

Raspberry PI credentials: 
user: pi
